# genderspace-web 🌌

Welcome to `genderspace-web`. At its heart, this platform is a resource primarily built with transgender individuals in mind. While it's open to everyone within the LGBTQIA+ community 🏳️‍🌈, the features and tools are largely centered around the unique experiences of transgender folks.

## Proposed Features 🛠

### 1. **Voice Training System** 🎙

A simple, practical approach to:

-   Help users practice pronunciation.
-   Analyze elements like tone, pitch, and resonance.
-   Opportunities for peer feedback in the future.

### 2. **HRT Progress Tracker** ⏳

**Please Note**: This is an auxiliary tool and does not replace medical advice.

-   Users can log their HRT experiences over time.
-   Capture physical and emotional changes.
-   Option to track blood levels, compared to general benchmarks.

### 3. **Community Hub** 💬

A space for genuine connections and shared experiences:

-   Moderation tools to ensure a safe environment 🛡.
-   Users have the ability to report any concerns ⚠️.
-   Customizable profiles to express oneself 🎨.

### 4. **Discord Bot** 🤖

Still in the conceptual stage, aiming for better community integration.
